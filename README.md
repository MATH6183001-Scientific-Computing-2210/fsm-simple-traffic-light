# Simple Traffic Light using FSM

## Instruction

A traffic light has three LEDs, i.e., red, yellow, and green.
The traffic light has an internal timer that triggers an interrupt every 3s.
Initially, the light turns red.
But after the timer sends the interrupt signal, the light turns yellow. 
After another 3s, the light turns green. 
Then, it will turn red again after another 3s.

Please simulate and design a traffic light use case defined above by using:
    
- FSM
- Transition table
- Karnaugh map
- Combinatorial equations

and implement it using:

- the equation that you obtain by using K-map
- C language
